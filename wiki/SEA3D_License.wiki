We create SEA3D to help the development of games based on the technology we use in the company Sunag Entertainment.

We intend to expand SEA3D for platforms beyond the Flash Player being able to create games for both the Web and Desktop.

The *SEA3D License is compatible with the MIT License* a liberal license that can be used for both commercial content or not.

*Their dependencies uses other license types that have to be consulted.*

We ask everyone who can disseminate our material by placing it in forums and blogs or labels in your project.
